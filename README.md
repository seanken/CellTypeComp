# Cell Type Composition Comparision

This directory contains code for comparing between methods for single cell composition analysis (aka differential abundance) methods. It is currently just a mix of different scripts. Time permitting we will try to transform it into a proper package, but that is not likely to happen soon.

The scripts to actually run the comparisions are the scripts starting with Central.Test. 

Note the propel.core.modified.R script is a slightly modified version of a script from the speckle package, for real use cases should use their package.`
